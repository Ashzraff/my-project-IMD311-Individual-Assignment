I was instructed to go see my supervisor which is Puan Norhazliza Binti Hj.Mohd Razali. At  first,  she  were
briefing about industrial training at Bahagian Pembangunan Modal Insan(BPMI). She was briefing about  what  I 
need to do inside that department and where I will go after I done my job in that department. So, I began  my 
work inside that department by doing task given by my supervisor which is Record Latest Statistic on  Monthly
Programmed using Microsoft Excel.Then followed by designing posters for the event that the Library  need   to 
launch at that time.The next day, I go to the same  department  and  start a  day  with  discussion  with  my 
supervisor on my daily report.Because in my training, I need to provide a  report to  show my  lecturer  when 
enter the next semester.So, the day goes on by doing another similar task which is designing another  posters
for the events. You need to know in National Library, they need to create many events to make people come and 
visit the library, so all my task at that time is designing posters and make a data entry.Another day goes by,

<blockquote><pre style="color:white;">A week goes by and this week I need to work at a different  department  which is Bibliography
Center. At first,I go to see Puan Azura Ahmad for the briefing because she is my supervisor at that department.
In that briefing, I was tell and shown how all the work is done by all the workers in that department.She also
tell me that Bibliography section is actually quite tricky if you not focus when  doing  your  work because in
this section you need to record more than 200 plus books, so if you are not focus, the information record  can
be false and can create many problems later in another department. In that record you need to include the name 
of the author,place of that book is publish, the call number of that book, content inside that book  and  many 
other things that important for users to know when they want to borrow and buy a books. After that, I  need to 
make a confirmation list for book receipt. This is actually important because you need to  check all the books 
received from National Library is received in a perfect condition. It  is  actually  a  challenging  day but I 
somehow get through that day just find. The next day, I was given a briefing about what is Monograph,  how  to 
use RFID and how to make indexing.I was teach how to use RFID.RFID is actually a scanner that you need to scan 
at the back of the books and it will automatically saved the information inside that books.  After that, I was 
told to do a index. When making index you need to choose only the important part of  that books,  magazines or
newspaper such as the title of the story, what contents inside that materials and who  is the  author of  that 
story. Then mark it page by page using sticky note so the other workers can easilly write down the information 
inside the system. I was in this department for 2 weeks. It was a stressfull weeks, it  was  a  lot  going  on 
because like I said you need to record more than 200 books. On the second week, I need to do RFID patching and 
registration number. What I need to do is get all the registration number for the books that  I need  to patch 
then stick the registration number at the front of the books with the correct measure, followed  by stick  the 
RFID at the back of the books. After all that, my 2 weeks in Bibliography Center is done.</pre></blockquote>
